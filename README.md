In this project, I have done exploratory data analysis of the 'Car Evaluation Data Set. 

Furthermore I have trained classification model for this dataset using KNN Classifier. Model accuracy showed the result of 94.21 %, as well as the confusion matrix.

For the implementation of this project, Python was used as a programming language, and Jupyter Notebook as a computational environment.
When it comes to the libraries used in Python,
library used for data manipulation is pandas. In particular, pandas was used primarily to read a CSV file into a DataFrame, and afterwards manipulate with it.
For interactively plotting the data, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn were used.
And finally, library used for the Machine Learning tools is sklearn, which contains simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. In particular, modules used from this library are:
sklearn.neighbors for kNN classifier implementation, sklearn.preprocessing for feature scaling and conversing from non-numerical to numerical values, sklearn.model_selection for splitting the data, and sklearn.metrics for results measures.
